I am looking for an internship between march and august 2021. <br><br> Since the age of 6 I have been practicing sports several times a week. I first played soccer and then badminton. Three years ago, I joined the Gones de Lyon to play Flag Football, a mixed and non-contact variant of American Football. All these years on the field have developed my team spirit and perseverance. <br><br> Since high school I have been involved in the associative sector. At the time, I was organizing charity events and conducting workshops with children for Unicef. Today, in addition to my role as secretary of the association La Cruz, I am part of the communication team of my Flag Football team and I assist the coaches in the organization of the tournaments. <br><br><br> I am looking for an internship between march and august 2021.",
  "label.perso.bio.idoux": "Active person and always looking for a project or an activity, I've been passionate about computers since I was very young. I extended my knowledge with a computer science degree in Orleans and I continue to develop my skills at the university Lyon 1, in master TIW (Information and Web Technologies).<br /><br />I managed to combine passion and work during my studies thanks to the different projects I did. My interest for the web world started when I knew the Site du Zéro and started building sites for communities on video games. I continued on small personal projects to finally meet the association La Cruz where I was able to sharpen my skills. During my studies, I was able to participate in several video game projects that motivated me to work outside of school.<br />Today, my career path and my projects have allowed me to acquire practical and indispensable skills. I have been able to apply my school knowledge in other areas and learn more about development and project management.<br /><br />Being currently in my second and last year of my master's degree, I am looking for a final year internship in web development from February / March 2021 for a period of 5 to 6 months.",
  "label.perso.bio.sabard": "Passionate about science and video games since I was very young, I decided to make it my profession.<br /><br /> It all started with the site du zéro (now openclassroom) in college and then with a course at the University of Savoie and Lyon 1.<br /><br /> Always eager for new things, I am always looking for new project ideas. Mainly oriented on web technologies, I am not closed to this domain. For me, versatility is one of the keys to success!",
